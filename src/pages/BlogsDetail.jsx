                The circular economy model focuses on designing products and
                processes that minimize waste and keep materials in use for as
                long as possible. Companies are increasingly adopting this
                model, designing products that are easier to recycle and
                creating systems for product take-back and recycling.

                Recycling is more than just a buzzword; it’s a critical practice
                for preserving our planet. Every small effort counts, and here’s
                why recycling should be an integral part of your daily routine.

                1. Conservation of Natural Resources
              </h4>
              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Recycling helps conserve natural resources like minerals, water,
                and timber. By reusing materials, we reduce the need for new raw
                materials, which often involves environmentally destructive
                extraction processes.

              </h4>
              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Recycling requires significantly less energy than producing new
                products from raw materials. For instance, recycling aluminum
                saves up to 95% of the energy needed to create new aluminum from
                bauxite ore. These energy savings translate into reduced
                greenhouse gas emissions.

                Landfills are overflowing with waste, much of which could be
                recycled. By recycling, we reduce the volume of waste sent to
                landfills, extending their lifespan and minimizing environmental
                pollution.

                Recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste

                Adopting recycling practices is a way to take personal
                responsibility for the waste we generate. It encourages
                mindfulness about consumption and waste, promoting a more
                sustainable lifestyle.

                Every small effort you make to recycle contributes to a larger

                recycling. Together, we can make a significant difference.
